"""Figures for rung 0, the assay-reliability measurement.

Rung 0 asks how much of a drug's transcriptional response survives being measured twice. The
screen's replicate plates for one (patient line, drug) condition are split into two groups, each
group is differentially expressed against its own controls, and the two half-profiles are
correlated -- once over all genes, once over the genes the FIRST group alone called responders.
The figures here are how a reader checks that measurement rather than taking it on trust.

Two rules from the task design hold for every function in this module.

**A figure is drawn from a committed table.** Each function takes an already-computed table and
an output path, and reads nothing else -- no database, no raw counts, no statistic recomputed
from the screen. If a number is drawn on a figure it came from a table that ships beside the
figure, so a reader can recompute it. One case looks like an exception and is in fact the rule
enforced: the example scatters print each condition's own correlation, and because that number is
computed here it is written back out with the exact points it was computed from, so the printed
value stays checkable.

**A figure that has a control shows it beside the real data on shared axes.** Real data alone
says what the screen looks like; real data beside a pool with a planted answer says whether the
machinery reads it correctly. Every such panel names which side is which in its title or legend.

Every function returns the path it wrote, and every function tolerates a thin or empty table
without raising: the figure step runs at the end of a long cluster job, and a crash there throws
away the whole run.

    reproducible response; a round cloud is a condition whose measured response is mostly noise.

    A condition's two half-profiles disagree for two separable reasons. Each plate carries its
    own batch offset, so profiles built from different plates differ even with infinite cells --
    that is the between-plate variance. And each plate counts a finite number of cells, so its
    fold changes carry sampling error, which DESeq2 already reports as ``lfcSE``. Which of the
    two dominates decides what would actually raise the ceiling: more plates, or deeper plates.

    Panel (a) is the between-plate share of the total. Panel (b) is the same comparison one gene
    at a time, plate variance against mean squared standard error, with the identity line drawn:
    points above the line are rows whose disagreement is batch, points below are rows whose
    disagreement is counting. Reading which side of that line the mass sits on is the whole
    purpose of the panel, so both axes are log-scaled over the positive rows, where variances
    span orders of magnitude.

    Panels (c) and (d) ask whether that share is constant across the screen or depends on where
    in it you stand -- lowly expressed genes are sampling-limited, and strongly responding genes
    have more real signal for a batch offset to be measured against. A control pool with a

    condition's first half against a DIFFERENT condition's second half. Three such nulls are
    drawn, in increasing strictness. Any mismatched pair is the loosest. Different drug and
    different line is the generic-structure floor -- whatever any perturbation does to any line.
    Same drug, different line is the strictest, because two lines given the same drug already
    share that drug's generic response; clearing this one is what makes a reliability specific to
    the line rather than to the drug.

    One panel per gene set, with each stratum's mean marked. The matched distribution has to sit
    to the right of all three, and visibly so, or the reliability is measuring shared structure
    rather than a reproducible line-specific response.

    The p-values are read off a bootstrap that resamples null draws as if each were independent.
    They are not: mismatched draws reuse the same half-profiles many times over, so each draw
    shares a whole half-profile with many of its neighbours. That dependence makes the true
    sampling distribution of the null mean WIDER than the independent bootstrap believes, and a
    null that is too narrow makes every p-value look better than it is.

    So the permutation check permutes the pairing itself, which preserves the reuse structure,
    and its distribution of the mean is drawn here against the normal curve the independent
    bootstrap assumes -- same centre, standard deviation of the draws over the square root of the
    condition count. The two widths are meant to be compared directly: their ratio is the design
    effect, and it is the factor by which the bootstrap's error bar is too small.
