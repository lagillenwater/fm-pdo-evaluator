"""The executable verification entry point runs green in continuous integration (PROCESS section 3).

The notebook `docs/tasks/rung0-assay-reliability/verify.ipynb` is committed without outputs so a
reviewer executes it and watches the checks pass themselves; these tests run the same battery so
the branch's green does not depend on anyone opening the notebook. Every check recomputes a
reported number from the run's own artifacts, so a failure here means a document and an artifact
disagree -- the drift class the audits used to catch by reading.

The last test is the design's `document` step negative control. A battery that reports PASS on
evidence somebody altered is measuring nothing, so one number in the summary row is changed and
the real battery is required to fail, naming the claim that moved.
