# How we operate

This is the operating manual: the workflow, tooling, and collaboration mechanics for this project.
It answers "what do I do and in what order," not "what must every number respect" (that's `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md`'s project rules) and not "what's true right now" (that's `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md`).
Read those two after this one, before starting work.

## 0. Start here, every session

1. Read `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md`'s spec tree — is there already an OPEN branch covering what you're about to do?
   Extend that task's `docs/tasks/<task-slug>/design.md` or explicitly supersede it; don't open a second task on the same subject.
2. Read `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` — is the thing you're about to fix already fixed, already known broken with a reason, or already being worked in a session you'd be racing?
3. Check `git log --oneline -20` on the branch you're on.
   Multiple sessions (this machine and Alpine, sometimes concurrently) touch this repo; the two documents above are the coordination mechanism, not tribal memory of who's doing what.


## 1. The work lifecycle

**Rung, step, task** are defined in [`docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md`](PROJECT_SPEC.md) and used precisely here: a rung is a scientific question, a step is a stage of the pipeline every rung passes through, a task is a unit of work with a spec and a definition of done.
Tasks open and close; steps never do; rungs are answered.


**Brainstorm → Design spec → Implementation plan → Execute → Review → Verify → Promote.**

**Work is organized by task, not by date.**
Every task owns one directory, `docs/tasks/<task-slug>/`, named for what the task does (`rung0-replicate-ceiling`, `embargo-gate-cell-values`) with no date prefix.
The slug is the task's identity: it is what `PROJECT_SPEC.md`'s spec tree keys on and what `PROJECT_STATE.md` links to.
Dates live in git and in each document's own header line.

| Stage | Where it lives | Skill |
|---|---|---|
| Brainstorm | (conversation) | `superpowers:brainstorming` |
| Design spec | `docs/tasks/<task-slug>/design.md` | (write directly, or via brainstorming's output) |
| Implementation plan | `docs/tasks/<task-slug>/plan.md` | `superpowers:writing-plans` |
| Task-local decisions | `docs/tasks/<task-slug>/decisions.md` | — |
| Execute | code changes | `superpowers:executing-plans` or `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`, with `superpowers:test-driven-development` and `superpowers:systematic-debugging` as needed |
| Review | — | `superpowers:requesting-code-review` / `receiving-code-review` |
| Verify | — | `superpowers:verification-before-completion` — evidence before "done," always |
| Promote | `docs/results/*.csv` + `.provenance.json` sidecar | `scripts/promote_result.py` |
| Cross-task reversal | `docs/decisions/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` | — |
| Close out | branch merge/PR | `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch` |

Three rules keep the task folder from becoming another orphan:

1. **Create the folder when you write the design spec**, and in that same change add the task's branch to `PROJECT_SPEC.md`'s spec tree, under its rung or under cross-cutting.
   A task folder outside the tree is invisible to the next session, which is the failure mode this structure exists to prevent.
2. **One task, one folder.**
   Extending existing work means editing that task's `design.md`, not starting `<something>-v2`.
   If the scope genuinely changes into different work, open a new task and supersede the old one explicitly (§5).
3. **`PROJECT_STATE.md` links back to the folder.**
   Every status entry names its task's `design.md`, the commits that implemented it, and the outputs it produced (§5) — that link is what makes a number traceable to the intent behind it.

`docs/decisions/` stays dated, because a decision is an event, not a task: it records what was reversed and when.
Decisions made *inside* a task, that only bind that task, go in its `decisions.md`.

**Promotion is the line between "we ran something" and "it's evidence."**
A result without a `.provenance.json` sidecar is not citable in a write-up, per this project's own standing rule — see project rule 8 in `PROJECT_SPEC.md`.

## 2. Compute: local vs. Alpine

- **Local (this machine)**: interactive development, doc/spec work.
  Run `uv run pytest` here before every push.
- **Alpine**: anything needing real compute.
  Access is exclusively through `./scripts/alpine/ralpine` — never raw `ssh`/`scp`.
  That boundary is enforced in version-controlled script code (`READ_ONLY` allowlist + `reject_metacharacters`), not in a permission string, specifically so it's reviewable.
- **Deployment is git-only**: `git push` → `ralpine update` (git pull --ff-only on the Alpine checkout) → `ralpine submit`.
  Never copy a file to Alpine directly — if Alpine needs a file that isn't code, that's a sign it belongs in `data/` with a download/build script, not a one-off transfer.
- **Chained jobs**: pass `--dependency=afterok:<jobid>` etc. to `ralpine submit`; the wrapper reorders args correctly, but *verify* with `ralpine run scontrol show job <id> | grep Dependency` after submitting — a chain that silently drops its dependency runs immediately and out of order.
- **Verify inputs exist before submitting.**
  `ralpine ls`/`ralpine run find` the files a job needs first.
- **Standing permissions** : `git commit`/`git push` to `origin`, `ralpine submit`/`cancel`/`update`, all without per-action confirmation.
  `submit` is the working default — an agent stages the run and submits it.
  `cancel` covers this project's own jobs that are stale (superseded by a newer submission, or running code that a later commit has already fixed) or running far past their expected wall time; never another user's job, and never a whole array range, which `ralpine cancel` refuses structurally by taking exactly one numeric id.
  Still confirm before force-push, `git reset --hard`, branch deletion, or anything touching `upstream` or `main`.
  A standing grant is scoped to what it says — if a new branch or a materially different kind of action comes up, ask.

## 3. Verification discipline

- **Test on synthetic data before spending cluster time.**
  Build a small synthetic fixture that exercises the real code path (not a reimplementation of its logic — see project rule 4), run it locally, confirm the shape and sign of the result look right, *then* submit to Alpine.
- **Every reported statistic needs a known-answer test.**
  Plant a signal, require it recovered; plant nothing, require null.
  The test imports the real function.
- **Run the full local suite before every push**: `uv run pytest -q`.
- **Run the project-rule tests for what you touched.**
  `uv run pytest tests/test_project_rules.py` every time — six of those are repository- or artifact-wide scans, so they catch a violation the task never intended — plus `-m` for the steps named in the task's `design.md` header, e.g. `uv run pytest -m "step_split or step_score"`.
  The step-to-rule-to-test mapping sits under each rule in `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md`, and the steps are markers registered in `pyproject.toml`, so the selection is the same whichever rung or dataset the task is about.
  A strict `xfail` in that run is a recorded gap, not a pass: if the task closed one, the test becomes an unexpected pass and the marker comes out in the same change.
- **`verification-before-completion` applies to claims, not just code**: before saying something is fixed, promoted, or done, show the command and its output.
  "Should work now" is not done.

## 4. Git and collaboration

- **Branches**: `worktree-<topic>`, checked out under `.claude/worktrees/<topic>/` alongside the main checkout (`git worktree list` shows all active ones — check for collisions before naming a new one).
- **Commit messages state the root cause, not just the change**, written so a future session (or another agent) can tell what happened and why without re-deriving it from the diff — this is the established convention in this repo's own history, not a preference introduced this session. Do not include specific result numbers in the commit message. Reference the outputs and summary documents. 
- **Push to `origin`** (the `lagillenwater` fork).
  **Never `upstream`** (`greenelab`) without being explicitly told.
  Greene Lab standard beyond this fork: fork-per-contributor, PRs only, minimum one lab-member approval, one functional area per PR.
- **Multiple sessions run concurrently** (this branch carries provenance sidecars pointing at *another machine's* `/private/tmp/` scratch path, written the same day by a different session).
  Don't assume you're the only session touching this repo — `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` and recent git log are how you find out, not memory of who was told to do what.

## 5. Documentation discipline

Full rules in `docs/PROJECT_SPEC.md`'s "Process for new specs" section; the short version:

- A new task = a `docs/tasks/<task-slug>/design.md` **and** a spec-tree branch in `PROJECT_SPEC.md` pointing at it, in the same change.
- Superseding a doc = a one-line dated banner on the *old* doc pointing to the new one, **and** an index-row update in `PROJECT_SPEC.md`, in the same change.
  Not one or the other.
- Reversing an architecture, method, or data source = a decision entry in `docs/decisions/`. No exceptions.
- A number change = `docs/PROJECT_STATE.md` updated in the same change that produced it, and that entry carries its three links: **spec** (the task's `design.md`), **code** (the commits or files that changed), **outputs** (the promoted CSV + sidecar, job id, figure).
  A status claim with no link to the spec that motivated it, the code that produced it, and the artifact it came from is a claim a future session has to re-derive from git log — which is exactly how the CoderData reversal stayed invisible for two months.

## 6. Definition of done

- **A bug fix**: a real test (imports the actual function) passes locally; if it touches a promoted number, that result is re-run, re-promoted with a fresh sidecar, and the document that reported the old number gets a correction banner — never a silent edit.
- **A new capability**: went through brainstorm → spec → plan in one `docs/tasks/<task-slug>/` folder, indexed in `PROJECT_SPEC.md`, with `PROJECT_STATE.md`'s entry linking spec, code, and outputs.
- **A claim of "complete"**: backed by command output you actually ran, not by what the code should do.

## 7. Failure modes this process exists to prevent

Written down because each has already cost this project real time, and because the lesson outlives the specific confusion.

- **A newer, more authoritative-looking document can itself be the source of drift.**
  The most recent design doc is the one everyone cites, which is exactly why an error in it propagates fastest.
  Recency is not accuracy: a new spec must be checked against the code and the specs it supersedes, not just written down.
- **Renaming a concept without a forward pointer leaves every prior document silently ambiguous.**
  A code-level rename with a working alias reads as complete while every document using the old name keeps meaning something slightly different.
  A rename is a two-line fix in the documents that used the old name; do it at rename time, not retroactively.
- **A parallel implementation that bypasses an abstraction silently drops that abstraction's guarantees.**
  When a driver is written to call a library directly because the registry path is inconvenient, every guarantee the registry provided — leakage filtering, shared partitions — quietly stops applying, and no output says so.
  If a guarantee matters, it belongs where it cannot be routed around.
- **A reversal with no decision entry is invisible to everyone but git log.**
  Reverting an architecture, a method or a data source and writing nothing down leaves the next reader to rediscover it from commit archaeology, or to reinstate what was deliberately removed.
  Project rule 10 exists for this; a terse entry written late still beats none.
