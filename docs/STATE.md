# Project state

**Reads against** [`docs/SPEC.md`](SPEC.md).
The spec says what each rung must establish and what a passing result means; this document says where each one stands.
It carries no history: a rung's result belongs here, how it came to be belongs in git and in that rung's spec.

**As of** 2026-08-27.

A number not carried here with its provenance record is not evidence.
Promotion means a result in `results/<task-slug>/` with a `<result>.provenance.json` beside it recording the commit, job and inputs that produced it — project rule 1.
No `results/` directory exists yet, so nothing in this repository is evidence of anything.

## Ladder status

| Rung | What the spec requires | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 0 — replicate ceiling | A reproducibility ceiling clearing its null, on the declared panel | Not started |
| 1 — held-out line | Prediction beating a floor and recovering a planted signal, as a fraction of rung 0 | Not started |
| 2 — bulk read by a single-cell model | A synthesised population landing near the same material's real single cells, clearing a mismatched-line null | Not started |
| 3 — cross-platform | Retention separable from a scrambled-line control | Not started |
| 4 — GDSC2 viability | Interaction above zero after correction, against the screen-agreement ceiling | Not started |
| 5 — organoid viability | The transfer number, on a frozen embargoed holdout | Not started |
| 6 — prospective | A registered prediction holding on organoids screened afterwards | Not started |

A rung closes when its result is promoted with provenance, this table records it, and the project-rule tests for the steps it touches pass.


## What this repository holds today

| Present | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Schema, determinism and adapter scaffolding, with tests | The apparatus a rung is added to exists; nothing here yet produces a measurement |
| No `results/` directory | Rung 0 is the first work to promote a number, and the first to be held to the rules in the spec |
| `docs/adapter_contract.md` and `docs/environment.md`, predating this spec | Neither has been reconciled against it. The rung that first depends on either brings it into line rather than a sweep that touches everything at once |

## Where things live

- **Results** `results/<task-slug>/<result>.csv` with `<result>.provenance.json` beside it. No provenance record, no evidence.
- **Figures** produced by a run, pointed at from that task's `verification.md`; a figure the project cites is promoted alongside its table.
- **Rung and task specs** `docs/tasks/<slug>/design.md`, one folder per task, arriving with the work it specifies.
- **Decisions** dated and appended to the bottom of the task's own `design.md` and `plan.md`, so a reversal travels with the document it reverses.
- **Rules and their tests** `docs/SPEC.md` and `tests/test_project_rules.py`.
- **The summary a reader opens first** `README.md`, which restates this document's status line and the ladder from `docs/SPEC.md`. It moves whenever either does.
